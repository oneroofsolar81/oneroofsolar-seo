          {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much do solar panels cost in Darwin?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A standard 6.6kW residential solar system in Darwin costs between $7,500 and $10,000 before government incentives. After STCs the net cost is typically lower. Federal solar incentives help reduce upfront system costs. We provide written quotes at no charge."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is solar worth it in Darwin's wet season?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Darwin receives high solar irradiance even during the wet season. While cloud cover reduces output on heavy rain days, Darwin's annual solar hours remain well above the national average. Darwin electricity prices are among the highest in Australia, which strengthens the financial case for solar year-round."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you install solar panels in Palmerston?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Palmerston is one of our core service areas. We install across Durack, Driver, Moulden, Gray, Woodroffe, Rosebery, Bellamack, Bakewell, Gunn, Zuccoli, Johnston, and Mitchell. Our team works in Palmerston regularly."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do battery storage systems work in Darwin?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A solar battery stores surplus solar power generated during the day for use during peak evening hours or during wet season grid outages, maximising self-consumption and lowering your electricity bills."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you install solar in Alice Springs?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Oneroof Solar services Alice Springs for residential and commercial solar installations. Alice Springs has excellent solar resource with very high irradiance levels year-round. Our team travels to Alice Springs regularly. Contact us for a quote specific to your Alice Springs property."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are your solar panels cyclone rated?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. All panels and racking systems we install across the NT are rated to withstand cyclone-strength winds. Darwin's building codes require higher wind load standards than most of mainland Australia. We only use mounting systems certified to NT wind categories, with a structural assessment before every installation."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I get solar with $0 upfront in Darwin?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Oneroof Solar offers $0 deposit solar plans through approved finance partners. Finance terms vary by product. Our team will walk you through all available options at your consultation so you can compare the true cost of each plan before committing."}},
          {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does solar installation take in Darwin?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Most residential solar installations in Darwin are completed in a single day. From quote approval to switching on, most Darwin customers are operational within two to four weeks, depending on Power and Water Corporation connection timelines."}}

                Darwin gets more sunshine per year than almost any other Australian city. That means solar panels here work harder, produce more, and pay back faster than anywhere else in the country. Oneroof Solar was founded in Darwin to install solar systems specifically suited to the Top End - high UV, heavy wet seasons, cyclone-rated equipment, and territory humidity.

                We handle everything from your initial consultation and system design through to installation, grid connection, and ongoing support. Our team are NT-based, locally licensed, and familiar with Darwin's unique grid setup, power bills, and weather patterns.

              {
                q: "How much do solar panels cost in Darwin?",
                a: "A standard 6.6kW residential solar system in Darwin costs between $7,500 and $10,000 before government incentives. After STCs the net cost is typically lower. Federal solar incentives help reduce upfront system costs. We provide written quotes at no charge."
              },
              {
                q: "Is solar worth it in Darwin's wet season?",
                a: "Yes. Darwin receives high solar irradiance even during the wet season. While cloud cover reduces output on heavy rain days, Darwin's annual solar hours remain well above the national average. Darwin electricity prices are among the highest in Australia, which strengthens the financial case for solar year-round."
              },
              {
                q: "Do you install solar panels in Palmerston?",

              },
              {
                q: "How do battery storage systems work in Darwin?",
                a: "A solar battery stores surplus solar power generated during the day for use during peak evening hours or during wet season grid outages, maximising self-consumption and lowering your electricity bills."
              },
              {
                q: "Do you install solar in Alice Springs?",
                a: "Yes. Oneroof Solar services Alice Springs for residential and commercial solar installations. Alice Springs has excellent solar resource with very high irradiance levels year-round. Our team travels to Alice Springs regularly. Contact us for a quote specific to your Alice Springs property."
              },
              {
                q: "Are your solar panels cyclone rated?",
                a: "Yes. All panels and racking systems we install across the NT are rated to withstand cyclone-strength winds. Darwin's building codes require higher wind load standards than most of mainland Australia. We only use mounting systems certified to NT wind categories, with a structural assessment before every installation."
              },
              {
                q: "Can I get solar with $0 upfront in Darwin?",
                a: "Yes. Oneroof Solar offers $0 deposit solar plans through approved finance partners. Finance terms vary by product. Our team will walk you through all available options at your consultation so you can compare the true cost of each plan before committing."
